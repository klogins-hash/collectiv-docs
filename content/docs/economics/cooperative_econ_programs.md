## Key Insight: The Cooperative Economics Niche

### Why This Changes Everything:

Your PBC creator platform is essentially **platform cooperativism meets AI displacement solutions**. This is a recognized field with its own academic infrastructure.

### The Two Paths:

**Path 1: Mainstream + Experimental (Original Recommendation)**
- MIT, Stanford, Chicago
- Frame as "field experiments" and "alternative institutions"
- Leverage experimental economics credibility
- Better placement, more prestigious

**Path 2: Heterodox + Cooperative (New Option)**
- Mondragon, New School (when reopens), UMass Amherst
- Frame as "cooperative economics" and "solidarity economics"
- Direct intellectual tradition
- More aligned philosophically but less prestigious

### Which Path Is Better for You?

**If your goal is:**
- **Academic prestige + mainstream acceptance** → Path 1 (MIT, Stanford, Chicago)
- **Philosophical alignment + cooperative movement** → Path 2 (Mondragon, New School, UMass)
- **Building the company is primary, PhD is secondary** → Path 1 (more flexible, better funded)
- **PhD is about legitimizing cooperative economics** → Path 2 (direct tradition)

## The Mondragon Question

### Why Mondragon Is Unique:

**Mondragon is to cooperative economics what MIT is to technology.**

- 70+ years of cooperative data
- 80+ cooperatives to study
- World's largest worker cooperative federation
- €12 billion in revenue
- 80,000+ worker-owners

**Your Research Could Be:**
- "Applying Mondragon cooperative principles to AI-native creator platforms"
- "Platform cooperativism as solution to AI displacement"
- "Governance structures for digital commons in the age of AI"

**The Pitch to Mondragon:**
"I'm building a PBC creator platform that applies cooperative principles to the digital economy. I want to study at Mondragon to understand how to scale cooperative governance for the AI age."

### Mondragon Advantages:
1. **Perfect intellectual fit** - they invented modern cooperative economics
2. **Real-world laboratory** - 80+ cooperatives to study
3. **Part-time option** - can build company while studying
4. **Small cohort** - maximum flexibility
5. **Unique credential** - "PhD from Mondragon" signals cooperative economics expertise

### Mondragon Disadvantages:
1. **Less prestigious** - not recognized in mainstream US economics
2. **Placement** - primarily Spain/Europe, not US academia
3. **Language** - Spanish/Basque culture (though English offered)
4. **Network** - smaller than MIT/Stanford

## Bottom Line on Cooperative Economics Programs

**Mondragon is the hidden gem** if your goal is to legitimize cooperative economics as a solution to AI displacement.

**But** if your goal is mainstream academic credibility + building the company, stick with MIT/Stanford/Chicago and frame it as "experimental economics" rather than "cooperative economics."

The heterodox/cooperative economics world is smaller, less prestigious, but more philosophically aligned with what you're doing.

**The strategic question:** Do you want to be inside the mainstream tent pushing it toward cooperatives (MIT/Stanford) or outside the tent building a new tradition (Mondragon/New School)?
