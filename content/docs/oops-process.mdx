## How We Handle Mistakes

**"Oops happens. Restoration follows."**

We hold each other accountable. But we always provide a path back.

---

## The Philosophy

Public accountability and community shaming are underutilized because the powerful want to live without accountability.

**We're reclaiming these tools to help good people live up to their best.**

This isn't punishment. It's restoration.

**"Making Shaming Great Again" (with love and a path back)**

## The 7 Steps to Restoration

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Oops

**Publicly acknowledge what happened. No hedging.**

Don't minimize. Don't deflect. Don't justify.

Just state what you did.

*Credit restoration: 0% (but it's required to move forward)*

### Step 2: Acknowledge Harm

**Demonstrate you understand the impact.**

Show empathy. Explain how your oops affected others.

This isn't about you feeling bad. It's about understanding the harm.

*Credit restoration: 0% (but required)*

### Step 3: Commit to Change

**Publicly commit to specific changes to prevent recurrence.**

What will you do differently? How will you ensure this doesn't happen again?

Be specific. Make it measurable.

*Credit restoration: 25%*

### Step 4: Disclose Proactively (The Self-Oops)

**Come forward voluntarily before being caught.**

This is the most powerful step. Self-reporting shows integrity.

**Bonus:** Self-oopsing gets you 50% faster restoration.

*This is why we encourage self-reporting.*

### Step 5: Make Amends

**Concrete action to fix what was broken.**

This isn't just words. This is doing the work to restore.

**"Restore Times Two" rule:** If handled via anonymous tip line, restore 2x the harm to keep it private.

*Credit restoration: Depends on amends made*

### Step 6: Release Grievances

**Let go of resentment toward those who reported you.**

They did you a favor by holding you accountable.

**Remember:** "If you report, you support." The person who reported you is committed to helping you restore.

*Credit restoration: Required to complete process*

### Step 7: Uphold Principles

**Demonstrate consistent adherence to cooperative values over time.**

This is the proof. Show through your actions that you've changed.

*Credit restoration: 100% + "Restored Member" status*

## The Anonymous Tip Line

**What it is:** A confidential way to report oopses

**How it works:**

### 1. Tip Submitted

Someone reports an oops anonymously. The tip line keeps it confidential.

### 2. Private Probation

The accused is notified privately. They have 48-72 hours to self-oops.

**This is a chance to handle it quietly.**

### 3. Investigation

If no self-oops, credit is suspended while we investigate.

### 4. Outcome

**Full confession:** Private resolution. Restore 2x the harm. Stays private.

**No confession:** Public oops process begins.

**The choice is yours:** Handle it privately with 2x restoration, or go through public process.

## Why This Works

### Accountability Without Destruction

We hold people accountable, but we don't destroy them.

**The goal is restoration, not punishment.**

### Self-Reporting Is Rewarded

Self-oopsing gets you faster restoration and shows integrity.

**This incentivizes honesty.**

### Community Support

"If you report, you support" means the person who reported you is committed to helping you restore (unless they're your victim).

**Accountability with support.**

### "Restored Member" Is an Honor

Completing restoration earns you a badge of honor, not shame.

**It shows you took accountability and came back stronger.**

## The Professional Standard

**This isn't radical.**

Lawyers, doctors, and CPAs all have public disciplinary records.

**We're simply applying professional standards to our cooperative.**

See:
- [State Bar Associations](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/lawyer_ethics_regulation/disciplinary_authorities/)
- [Medical Boards](https://www.fsmb.org/)
- [CPA Boards](https://nasba.org/)

**Professional accountability is normal. We're making it cooperative.**

## Examples of Oopses

**Financial oopses:**
- Over-spending cooperative resources
- Not fulfilling financial commitments
- Misusing credit system

**Work oopses:**
- Not delivering on commitments
- Over-promising and under-delivering
- Abandoning projects

**Community oopses:**
- Disrespecting other members
- Violating community guidelines
- Extractive behavior

**Governance oopses:**
- Not participating in votes
- Blocking progress without reason
- Abusing governance processes

**The severity determines the restoration required.**

---

## What Happens If You Don't Restore?

**Credit suspension** until you complete restoration.

**Loss of privileges** (voting, working group participation, etc.)

**Potential membership termination** (requires supermajority vote)

**But we really want you to restore.** That's always the preferred outcome.

---

## The "If You Report, You Support" Rule

**If you report an oops, you're committing to help that person restore.**

This means:
- Offering guidance
- Providing support
- Helping them through the process
- Celebrating their restoration

**Exception:** If the person harmed you directly, you're not required to support them.

**This ensures reporting isn't just punishment. It's community care.**
