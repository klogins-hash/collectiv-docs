## Welcome

This is the complete documentation for The Collectiv—a creator cooperative where you crowdfund to get in, own your IP and cooperative equity, and borrow against your equity to build wealth.

We're building tools and infrastructure together. You're not joining something finished. You're helping build something you'll own part of.

## Quick Reference

### The Three Core Principles

1. **Own Your IP** - You keep 100% ownership and control of everything you create
2. **Own Cooperative Equity** - You own a stake in everything we build together
3. **Build Wealth** - Borrow against your equity instead of cashing out (like billionaires do)

### The Economic Model in 3 Steps

1. **Crowdfund to get in** - Your contribution goes into the cooperative pool
2. **Own your IP + equity** - You own what you make and part of what we make together
3. **Borrow against equity** - Get cash when you need it, no taxes, equity keeps growing

### How Governance Works

- **One member, one vote** - Democratic decision-making
- **Transparent** - All decisions made in the open
- **Participatory** - Members propose, discuss, and vote on everything

### The Three Vows

**We will never:**
1. Take traditional Venture Capital
2. Go IPO
3. Sell to another company

**We're member-owned, forever.**
