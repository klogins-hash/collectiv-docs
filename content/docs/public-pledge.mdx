description: Our commitments to members and the community

## I'm Joining The Collectiv

**I, [Name], am joining The Collectiv.**

This isn't a transaction. It's a commitment.

I'm joining a community that values **ownership**, **mutual aid**, **transparency**, and **accountability**.

---

## My Commitments

### Financial Contribution

I'll contribute financially according to my ability.

My contribution supports the collective needs of the community. It goes into the pool that funds tools, infrastructure, and shared resources.

**I understand this is an investment, not a fee.**

### IP Ownership and Licensing

I own 100% of my intellectual property. Always.

If I choose to license my work to the cooperative, I do so on my own terms. I understand that sharing strengthens the whole, but it's always my choice.

**My IP is mine. Period.**

### Work Contribution

I'll fulfill the work commitments I make.

I won't over-promise and under-deliver. If I say I'll do something, I'll do it.

**My word matters.**

### Responsible Resource Usage

I'll use cooperative resources conservatively.

The pool isn't a personal piggy bank. It's shared capital that serves all members.

**I'll contribute more than I take.**

### Active Participation

I'll show up. I'll vote. I'll participate in governance.

I'm a citizen, not just a consumer.

**Governance only works if members participate.**

---

## Accountability

### The Self-Oops

If I violate these values, I'll report it immediately.

I won't hide my mistakes. Self-reporting shows integrity.

**See the [OOPS Process](oops-process.md) for details.**

### The Restoration Process

If I have an oops, I'll go through the restoration process.

I won't deflect, justify, or attack. I'll take accountability and restore.

**Restoration is the path back.**

### Reporting and Support

If I witness an oops, I'll report it.

**And if I report, I must support.** I'll help the person I reported find their way back (unless they're my abuser).

**Accountability without restoration is just punishment.**

---

## The Binary

**I am Collectiv, not Extractiv.**

I reject systems that exploit creators.

I commit to building a world where creators own what they make and build wealth together.

**I'm building, not extracting.**

---

## What This Means

### I'm Committing To:

- Contributing financially to the cooperative pool
- Owning my IP and choosing how to share it
- Fulfilling my work commitments
- Using resources responsibly
- Participating in governance
- Taking accountability for mistakes
- Supporting others through restoration
- Building, not extracting

### The Cooperative Is Committing To:

- Protecting my IP ownership
- Growing my equity over time
- Providing tools and resources
- Democratic governance (one member, one vote)
- Transparent operations
- Restoration when mistakes happen
- Building wealth for all members

**This is a two-way commitment.**
