# Program Matching Analysis: User's Collectiv Project

## User's Core Research Interests & Requirements

### Primary Research Question
"How do we take care of everyone's needs (Maslow's hierarchy) when half of those currently working are displaced by AI?"

### Key Research Themes
1. Collective economic systems and commons governance
2. AI/automation labor displacement
3. Universal needs provision within capitalist framework
4. Practical experimentation and implementation (not just theory)
5. Economic and social experiments at scale
6. Public Benefit Corporation structure as economic innovation

### Critical Program Requirements
- **Must support practical experimentation** - building real systems, not just writing about them
- **Interdisciplinary approach** - economics + technology + social systems
- **Field experiment capabilities** - real-world testing, not just lab studies
- **Faculty open to unconventional research** - alternative economic structures
- **Strong institutional support** - resources for ambitious projects
