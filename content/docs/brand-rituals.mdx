## How We Show Up

The Collectiv has a distinct culture. Here's how we communicate, hold each other accountable, and show up in the world.

---

## Core Principles

### Don't Take Yourself So Damn Serious

We're building something important, but we're not precious about it.

**We use:**
- Playful language for serious accountability
- Humor to make uncomfortable truths easier
- "Oopses" instead of violations
- Punk rock energy, not corporate speak

**We're builders, not bureaucrats.**

### Provocative and Memorable, But Not Trashy

We push boundaries. We say things others won't.

**But there's a line.**

If you cross from provocative into trashy, the community will yell **"TRASH!"** at you.

**It's a calibration mechanism, not a punishment.**

### Build, Don't Extract

**Collectiv:** Building wealth together. Creators own what they make.

**Extractiv:** Platforms taking cuts. Corporations extracting value.

**This binary defines everything we do.**

### Radical Transparency (Except IP)

Everything is public:
- Financial contributions
- Equity stakes
- Governance decisions
- Oopses and restorations

**The only exception:** Your raw IP. That's yours and private unless you choose to share.

**Transparency builds trust.**

### Accountability with Restoration

We hold each other to high standards. When someone messes up, we address it.

**But we always provide a path back.**

The goal isn't punishment. It's restoration and learning.

**See the [OOPS Process](oops-process.md) for details.**

## Cultural Rituals

These are the specific practices that make our culture distinct.

### The "TRASH!" Call-Out

**When:** Someone crosses from provocative into trashy

**What happens:** The community literally yells **"TRASH!"** at them

**Why:** It's a clear, immediate signal that you've crossed the line

**What next:** Recalibrate and try again

**This isn't mean. It's a cultural immune system.**

### Booing

**Active, vocal disapproval.**

**Internal booing:**
- "BOOOOOO" for bad proposals
- "BOOOOOO" for decisions that don't serve members
- "BOOOOOO" for extractive behavior

**External booing:**
- "BOOOOOO" for extractive companies
- "BOOOOOO" for platforms that exploit creators
- "BOOOOOO" for systems that extract value

**Booing is participatory democracy in action.**

### The "Ftou Ftou" (Spitting Gesture)

**Origin:** [Greek](https://www.greekboston.com/culture/superstitions/spitting/) and [Jewish tradition](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/spitting-to-ward-off-the-evil-eye/) to ward off evil

**Usage:** Say "Ftou ftou ftou" to ritually reject extractive energy

**Note:** It's the sound, not the saliva

**When to use:**
- When discussing extractive platforms
- When rejecting extractive offers
- When protecting the cooperative from bad actors

**It's playful, but it means something.**

### The Collectiv Doorpost Marker

**Origin:** Inspired by the [Jewish Mezuzah](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/mezuzah/)

**What it is:** A marker you place on your doorpost

**How to use:** Touch it and kiss your hand when entering to remember your values

**Why:** Physical reminder of your commitment to cooperative principles

**This makes membership tangible.**

### The Self-Oops

**You are expected to self-report immediately.**

If you do something that is or could be misconstrued as an oops, report it yourself.

**Why?** Self-reporting shows integrity and makes restoration easier.

**See the [OOPS Process](oops-process.md) for how this works.**

### The "Restored Member" Honor

**What it is:** A badge of honor for completing restoration

**Why it matters:** Shows you took accountability, learned, and came back stronger

**This is not a scarlet letter. It's a badge of growth.**

## Brand Voice

### Playful But Serious

Think [Jean-Ralphio](https://parksandrecreation.fandom.com/wiki/Jean-Ralphio_Saperstein) meets [Restorative Justice](https://restorativejustice.org/).

We're fun, but we mean it.

### Direct and Honest

No corporate speak. No jargon. No bullshit.

**Say what you mean. Mean what you say.**

### Provocative

We say things others won't.

"Making Shaming Great Again" (but with restoration, not punishment).

**We're not here to be polite. We're here to build something that works.**

### Self-Aware

We know we're a little weird. We're okay with that.

**"We're either brilliant or crazy. Probably both."**

### Builder-First

Everything comes back to building.

**"What can we help you build today?"**

---

## Taglines

**Primary:**
- "Collectiv, Not Extractiv"
- "We're building something. Want to help?"

**Secondary:**
- "Oops happens. Restoration follows."
- "Don't take yourself so damn serious."
- "Own what you make. Build wealth together."

**Provocative:**
- "Making Shaming Great Again (with restoration)"
- "We're either brilliant or crazy. Probably both."
- "Ftou ftou ftou to extractive platforms"

---

## How to Use These Rituals

### In Governance

**Booing** bad proposals shows immediate community sentiment.

**Self-oops** keeps governance honest and transparent.

**Restoration** ensures we can hold people accountable without destroying them.

### In Community

**"TRASH!" call-outs** keep the culture calibrated.

**"Ftou ftou"** creates shared language for rejecting extraction.

**Doorpost markers** make membership tangible and meaningful.

### In Marketing

**Provocative voice** cuts through noise.

**"Collectiv vs. Extractiv"** creates a clear binary choice.

**Playful accountability** makes serious topics accessible.

---

## Why This Matters

**Culture is how we coordinate at scale.**

These rituals:
- Create shared language
- Establish boundaries
- Enable accountability
- Build community
- Make membership meaningful

**Without culture, we're just a platform. With culture, we're a movement.**
