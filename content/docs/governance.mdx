title: Governance & Operations
description: How we make decisions and run the cooperative
---

## Overview

The Collectiv is member-owned and democratically governed. One member, one vote. We're figuring out the details as we go, but the principles are clear.

---

## Governance Principles

### Democratic Control

Every member gets one vote. Not one vote per dollar invested. Not weighted voting. Just one member, one vote.

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents wealth concentration from controlling decisions
- Ensures all voices are heard equally
- Aligns with cooperative values
- Keeps power distributed

### Transparent Decision-Making

All decisions are made in the open. Members can see proposals, discussions, and voting results.

**What we share:**
- Financial reports
- Strategic decisions
- Tool development priorities
- Governance proposals
- Voting outcomes

### Member Participation

Governance only works if members participate. We make it easy and rewarding to engage.

**How we encourage participation:**
- Simple voting interfaces
- Clear proposal formats
- Regular updates and communications
- Recognition for active members
- Low barrier to proposing ideas

---

## Governance Structure

### Member Assembly

**All members collectively.**

This is the highest decision-making body. Major decisions require member approval.

**What the Member Assembly decides:**
- Constitutional changes
- Major strategic direction
- Budget allocation (above certain thresholds)
- Governance structure changes
- Admission of new member classes

**How it works:**
- Proposals submitted by any member
- Discussion period (typically 7-14 days)
- Voting period (typically 3-7 days)
- Simple majority or supermajority (depending on decision type)

### Working Groups

**Self-organized teams focused on specific areas.**

Members form working groups to handle ongoing operations and specific projects.

**Example working groups:**
- Tool Development
- Member Support
- Financial Operations
- Marketing & Growth
- Governance & Policy

**How they work:**
- Any member can join any working group
- Groups have autonomy within their scope
- Major decisions still go to Member Assembly
- Regular reporting to all members

### Coordinators

**Members elected to coordinate specific functions.**

Not managers or bosses. Just coordinators who help organize work and facilitate communication.

**Coordinator roles:**
- Facilitate working group meetings
- Communicate updates to members
- Coordinate between working groups
- Propose decisions to Member Assembly
- Implement approved decisions

**How coordinators are chosen:**
- Nominated by members
- Elected by Member Assembly
- Term limits (typically 6-12 months)
- Can be recalled by members

## Financial Governance

- Voted on by Member Assembly
- Adjustments allowed quarterly

**Budget Categories**
- Tool development
- Infrastructure and operations
- Member benefits

## Conflict Resolution

### Informal Resolution

**First step:** Direct communication between parties

Most conflicts can be resolved through honest conversation.

### Mediation

If direct communication doesn't work, a neutral member helps facilitate resolution.

### Formal Process

**Third step:** Member Assembly review

For serious conflicts, the full membership reviews and votes on resolution.

### Appeals

Any member can appeal a decision to the Member Assembly.

## Tool Development Governance

### Priority Setting

**Members decide what gets built.**

**Process:**
1. Members propose tool ideas
2. Discussion and refinement
3. Vote on priorities
4. Development working group implements
5. Regular progress updates

### Feature Requests

**Any member can request features.**

**Process:**
1. Submit feature request
2. Community discussion
3. Development working group evaluates
4. Prioritized in roadmap
5. Implementation and release

### Quality Standards

**Tools must meet member needs.**

**Standards:**

## Communication

### Communication Channels

**Real-time Chat:** Quick questions and coordination
**Video Calls:** Working group meetings and town halls
**Email:** Important announcements and voting

### Transparency

**Default to open.**

Unless there's a specific reason for privacy (personal info, security), everything is shared with all members.

---

## Evolution

### Governance Isn't Static

We're figuring this out as we go. Governance will evolve based on what works and what doesn't.

**How governance changes:**
- Members propose improvements
- Discussion and refinement
- Vote on changes
- Implement and assess
- Iterate

### Learning from Others

We study other cooperatives, DAOs, and democratic organizations. We take what works and adapt it to our context.

### Experimentation

We're willing to try new approaches. If something doesn't work, we change it.

**The principle:** Governance serves members, not the other way around.

---

## The Bottom Line

**One member, one vote.**

**Transparent decision-making.**

**Member participation.**

We're building this together. Governance is how we coordinate. It's not perfect, but it's ours.

If you have ideas for how to make it better, propose them. That's how this works.
