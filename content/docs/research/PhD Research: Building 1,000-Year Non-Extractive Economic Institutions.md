# PhD Research: Building 1,000-Year Non-Extractive Economic Institutions

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research and analysis for PhD program applications focused on building AI-native, non-extractive economic institutions designed to last 1,000 years.

**Research Focus:** Can AI-native governance combined with non-extractive economic design enable cooperative systems to scale, and if so, how does this affect wealth distribution, coordination costs, and deadweight loss compared to traditional extractive platforms?

## Key Insights

### The Core Thesis

**2012 Insight:** Extraction creates deadweight loss (inefficiency)

**2012-2022 Learning:** Extraction exists because coordination is hard

**2022-2025 Realization:** AI removes the coordination constraint

**2024-2025 Experiment:** Building non-extractive systems at scale

**2026+ Goal:** Measure and formalize with academic rigor

### The System Design

1. **Legal Protection:** PBC structure + Series LLCs for each creator's IP
2. **Economic Incentives:** Disincentivize extraction, incentivize contribution
3. **Shared Access:** PBC owns assets, members share access
4. **AI Governance:** Reduces coordination costs below extraction costs
5. **Perpetual Royalties:** Smart contracts on derivative works
6. **Cultural Foundation:** "Recovering individualist" → communitarian

### The Technical Architecture: Built From Scratch

**"You can't put new wine in old skins."**

1. **AI-Native:** Built assuming AI coordination from day 1, not retrofitted
2. **Web3-Native:** Smart contracts, decentralized ownership, cryptographic proofs
3. **Privacy-First:** Zero-knowledge proofs, client-side encryption, we don't have access to most creator data
4. **Extraction-Proof:** Architecture makes extraction structurally impossible
5. **No Big Tech Access:** Even if acquired, buyer doesn't get user data

### The Strategic Vision: Four Target Groups

1. **Creators** ($250B → $1.35T by 2033) - AI-native, rapid growth, want to create
2. **Consultants** (tech layoffs → independence) - Need belonging and stability
3. **Athletes** (post-retirement) - Lifetime wealth, new purpose, incredible work ethic
4. **Small Businesses** (silver tsunami) - Keep IP, we license and staff, lifelong royalties

**The Thesis:** Communitarianism is the economically rational operating system for AI-enabled abundance. Not optimistic humanism—practical economics.

**The Architecture:** Built from scratch on AI-native, Web3-native, privacy-first foundations. Traditional platforms can't adopt this model—you can't put new wine in old skins.

## Quick Start

### For Application Review
1. Read `01-background/13-year-arc.md` for the complete narrative
2. Review `02-system-design/system-overview.md` for the platform design
3. Check `04-phd-programs/top-7-rankings.md` for program analysis
4. Use `05-application-materials/` for application strategy

### For Research Context
1. Start with `03-research-questions/extraction-inefficiency.md`
2. Review `06-literature-review/` for academic foundations
3. Read `02-system-design/` for the practical implementation

## Timeline

- **2012:** Economics student, making educational videos about extraction inefficiency
- **2012-2022:** Workday consultant, building enterprise coordination systems
- **2022-2025:** Realized AI enables non-extractive systems at scale
- **2024-2025:** Building The Collectiv PBC creator platform
- **2026:** PhD applications (target: Fall 2027 admission)
- **2027-2032:** PhD research while continuing to build and test
- **2032+:** Scale the institution toward 1,000-year sustainability
