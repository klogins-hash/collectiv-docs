# Research Notes: PhD vs Doctorate Degree in Economics

## Source 1: Walden University - PhD vs Professional Doctorate

### Key Differences:

**PhD (Doctor of Philosophy):**
- **Focus**: Academic degree focused on original research, data analysis, and evaluation of theory
- **Goals**: Advance the field through theoretical research; construct new knowledge or theories
- **Outcomes**: Conduct theoretical research OR seek tenured academic position in higher education
- **Student Population**: Those seeking theoretical research experience
- **Assessment**: Dissertation

**Professional Doctorate:**
- **Focus**: Focuses on applying research to practical problems, formulating solutions to complex issues, and designing effective professional practices
- **Goals**: Advance the field through applying existing body of knowledge, research, and theory; enrich knowledge base and research skills
- **Outcomes**: Practice in the field and advance to leadership OR teach in higher education institutions
- **Student Population**: Those seeking to solve practical problems in their field
- **Assessment**: Field-related doctoral study

### Both Degrees:
- Both are terminal degrees (highest formal degree in the field)
- Both require a master's degree for admission
- Doctoral degree holders earn about 20% more on average per week than those with master's degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics)

### Key Insight:
The main difference is that PhD focuses on **theoretical research and creating new knowledge**, while professional doctorate focuses on **applying existing knowledge to solve practical problems**.


## Source 2: PhD Portal - Doctorate vs PhD Terminology

### Key Clarification:
- **Doctorate** = The highest-level academic qualification (terminal degree)
- **PhD** = A specific TYPE of Doctorate degree
- PhD stands for "Doctor of Philosophy" (some universities use "DPhil")

### Two Main Categories of Doctorate Degrees:

**1. Academic Doctorate (includes PhD):**
- Research degree with theoretical focus
- Complete original research under supervisor guidance
- Compile thesis/dissertation
- Present findings and undergo oral examination (viva voce/defence)
- Best for careers in research or academia
- PhDs are the most common type of Academic Doctorate

**2. Professional Doctorate:**
- More applied and practical focus
- Examples: DBA (Business Administration), MD (Medicine), DPharm (Pharmacy), PsyD (Psychology), EdD (Education)
- Still involves original research, thesis, and defence
- Research conducted in real business or clinical settings
- Often completed part-time alongside regular job
- Best for advancing in non-academic careers

### Career Implications:
- PhD-holders can earn up to £3.10 more per hour than Master's degree holders (London School of Economics research)
- Academic Doctorates → careers in academia and research
- Professional Doctorates → careers in professional practice fields


## Source 3: American Economic Association - Graduate Degrees in Economics

### Types of Graduate Degrees in Economics:

**PhD in Economics:**
- Most advanced degree in economics
- Generally considered a research degree
- Takes 5-6 years (median time): 2 years coursework + remaining time for dissertation research/writing
- Curriculum includes:
  - Advanced courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, econometrics
  - Courses in student's field of specialization
  - Preliminary/qualifying/core examinations
  - Doctoral dissertation with oral defense
- Fields of specialization classified by Journal of Economic Literature

**Master's Degree in Economics:**
- Can be terminal degree OR preparation for PhD study
- Takes 2 years typically
- Includes courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, econometrics
- Terminal Master's requires completion of Master's thesis
- Sometimes awarded after completing designated phase of PhD program

**Joint Degree Programs:**
- Combine economics with other disciplines
- Common examples:
  - Joint PhD/JD (law)
  - Joint PhD in Economics and Finance
  - Joint PhD in Economics and Public Policy
  - Joint PhD in Economics and Statistics
  - Joint PhD in Economics and Applied Mathematics
- Variable time to completion
- Must meet degree requirements for both disciplines

### Important Note for Economics:
In economics, there is NO separate "professional doctorate" like DBA or EdD. The PhD is the standard terminal degree for both academic and non-academic careers in economics.


## Source 4: Quora Discussion - Economics PhD from Different Departments

### Key Findings:

**Economics PhD from Economics Department:**
- Awarded through economics department at research universities
- Rigorous core: microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics
- Emphasis on formal theory and proofs
- Broader range of specializations (macro, micro, trade, economic history, etc.)
- Generally considered more "hard core" theoretical

**Economics PhD from Business School:**
- Some business schools offer PhD in Economics or Business Economics (e.g., Stanford, Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard, MIT)
- Tend to focus on microeconomics and applied micro (labor, organizations, theory, industrial organization)
- Less emphasis on macro, economic history, or trade
- More focus on business-related economics research (financial economics, financial econometrics)
- Narrower focus on specializations like industrial organization and business strategy
- Top business school economics PhD programs can place graduates in top 10 economics departments
- Econ professors at business schools typically get paid higher
- Coursework very similar to economics department PhD in most cases

**DBA (Doctor of Business Administration):**
- Different from PhD in Economics
- Mentioned as what some business departments award instead of PhD
- More focused on business applications

### Important Distinction:
All of these are still PhD degrees (or DBA for business). In economics specifically, the PhD is the standard doctorate regardless of whether it's from an economics department or business school. The difference is in focus and specialization, not in the type of degree.
