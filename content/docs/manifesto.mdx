title: A Declaration of Interdependence
description: Why we're building The Collectiv
---

## Why We're Here

The world changed. Work changed. The rules changed.

We used to trade our time for security. That deal is over. Mass layoffs, AI disruption, gig economy—we're all independent contractors now, whether we wanted to be or not.

The old system was built for extraction. Platforms take cuts. Corporations take value. Financial institutions take returns. We get what's left.

**We're building something different.**

---

## What We're Building

The Collectiv is a creator cooperative. Member-owned. Member-operated. Built for creators who want to own what they make and build wealth together.

**Not a platform.** A project.

**Not finished.** Just started.

**Not selling you something.** Inviting you to build something.

### The Structure

We're legally structured as a [Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation) organized as a cooperative.

**What this means:**
- Members own the cooperative
- Members govern the cooperative (one member, one vote)
- Mission is legally protected
- Value flows to those who create it

**The three vows:**
1. We will never take traditional Venture Capital
2. We will never go IPO
3. We will never sell to another company

**We're member-owned, forever.**

## The Economic Model

**Traditional platforms:** You pay fees forever. They own the infrastructure. You're a renter.

**Traditional cooperatives:** Complex governance. Unclear value. Hard to join.

**The Collectiv:** You crowdfund to get in. You own your IP and cooperative equity. You borrow against your equity to build wealth.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Crowdfund to Join**

Your contribution goes into the general cooperative pool. Think of it as buying equity in a startup, except it's a cooperative and you actually own part of it.

**Step 2: Own Your IP + Equity**

You own everything you create (100%). You also own cooperative equity in everything the pool creates. Your equity grows as the cooperative grows.

**Step 3: Build Wealth**

Don't cash out. Borrow against your equity instead (like billionaires do). No taxes. Your equity keeps growing. We handle all the boring financial stuff.

**This is how you build real wealth.**

---

## What This Means

### For Creators

**Own your work.** Complete control. No platform takes a cut.

**Build wealth.** Cooperative equity grows over time. Borrow against it instead of cashing out.

**Access resources.** AI tools, creator tools, infrastructure, community.

**Govern together.** One member, one vote. Democratic decision-making.

### For the Cooperative

**Sustainable growth.** Crowdfund model provides capital. No dependency on outside investors.

**Compounding value.** More members = more capital = better tools = more value = higher equity.

**Mission alignment.** PBC structure ensures mission focus. Member ownership ensures alignment.

### For the Future

We're building a parallel economy. By creators, for creators.

**Not reforming the old world.** Building a new one.

**Not waiting for permission.** Building now.

**Not asking for approval.** Shipping and iterating.

## The Invitation

**We're not selling you a platform.**

**We're inviting you to help build something you'll own part of.**

You crowdfund to get in. You own your IP and cooperative equity. You borrow against your growing equity to build wealth.

We handle the boring stuff. You just build.

**What can we help you build today?**
