title: Business Model
description: How The Collectiv works economically
---

## Overview

The Collectiv is a creator cooperative using a crowdfund-to-equity model. We're building tools, infrastructure, and resources for creators who want to own what they make and build wealth together.

We're early. That's the point.

---

## What We Are

**Not a platform.** A project.

**Not finished.** Just started.

**Not selling you something.** Inviting you to build something.

We've got:
- Some AI tools
- Some creators  
- Some ideas

We're going to build some stuff together.

## The Economic Model

### How You Get In

**Crowdfund to join.**

Your contribution goes into the general cooperative pool. Think of it as buying equity in a startup, except it's a cooperative and you actually own part of it.

This isn't a monthly subscription. It's a one-time investment that gives you:
- Ownership stake in the cooperative
- Access to all tools and resources
- Governance rights (one member, one vote)
- Long-term equity that grows with the cooperative

### What You Own

**Two things:**

1. **Your IP (100%)**
   - You own everything you create
   - Complete control
   - No platform takes a cut
   - You decide what to do with it

2. **Cooperative Equity**
   - You own rights to the full value of everything your creations generate
   - You own equity in everything the cooperative builds
   - Your equity grows as the cooperative grows
   - This is long-term wealth building

### The Pool

All crowdfund contributions go into the general cooperative pool.

**The pool funds:**
- Tool development
- Infrastructure
- Shared resources
- Member benefits
- Cooperative operations

**The pool generates:**
- Revenue from tools and services
- Value from member creations
- Equity growth for all members

**You own a piece of all of it.**

## The Billionaire Trick (Made Easy)

### Why Billionaires Don't Cash Out

Rich people don't sell their equity. They borrow against it.

**Why?**
- Cashing out = taxes (30-40%)
- Borrowing = no taxes
- Your equity keeps growing
- You get cash when you need it

### We Built This In

You don't need to figure out the boring financial stuff. We handle it.

**How it works:**
1. Your cooperative equity grows over time
2. When you need cash, you borrow against your equity
3. We handle all the financial infrastructure
4. You just swipe your card
5. No taxes, your equity keeps growing

**This is how you build real wealth.**

## Revenue Model

### Phase 1: Crowdfunding (Current)
- Members contribute to join
- Funds go into cooperative pool
- Pool funds development and operations

### Phase 2: Tool Revenue (Near Future)
- AI tools generate revenue
- Creator tools generate revenue  
- Revenue flows back to the pool
- Member equity grows

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Revenue (Long Term)
- Services and infrastructure generate revenue
- Member projects generate value
- Cooperative equity compounds
- Members borrow against growing equity

### The Flywheel

More members → More pool capital → Better tools → More value created → Higher equity → More members

---

## Legal Structure

### Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)

We're legally structured as a Public Benefit Corporation.

**What this means:**
- We're legally bound to our mission
- Mission can't be subverted for profit
- We serve members, not outside shareholders
- This is permanent

### Cooperative Ownership

**Member-owned and operated.**

- One member, one vote
- Democratic governance
- Value flows to those who create it
- No outside investors control us

### The Three Vows

We will never:
1. Take traditional Venture Capital
2. Go IPO
3. Sell to another company

**We're member-owned, forever.**

## Why This Works

### The Insight

Creators want to own what they make. They want to build wealth, not just earn income. They want community, not isolation.

But the existing options are:
- Platforms that extract value
- Cooperatives that are too complex
- DIY that's too hard

**We're the third option that actually works.**

### The Model

- **Accessible** - Easy to understand and join
- **Valuable** - Real equity, real wealth building
- **Sustainable** - Member-owned, mission-aligned
- **Scalable** - Flywheel economics

### The Timing

Work is changing. The gig economy is here. AI is disrupting everything.

Creators need new structures. We're building them.

## The Bottom Line

**We're not selling you a platform.**

**We're inviting you to help build something you'll own part of.**

You crowdfund to get in. You own your IP and cooperative equity. You borrow against your growing equity to build wealth.

We handle the boring stuff. You just build.

That's the model.
