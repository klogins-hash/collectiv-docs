# The 13-Year Arc: From Theory to Practice to Institution-Building

## Timeline Overview

**2012 → 2025:** From understanding extraction inefficiency to building systems that eliminate it

---

## 2012: The Theoretical Foundation

### Economics Student at Utah State University

**The Insight That Started Everything:**

While studying tariff welfare effects in Economics 3400, I encountered the concept of **deadweight loss** - the value that simply disappears when you extract from a system.

**What I Learned:**
- When you impose a tariff (or any extractive mechanism):
  - Consumer surplus decreases by X
  - Producer surplus increases by Y
  - Government revenue increases by Z
  - **But X > Y + Z**
- The difference is deadweight loss - value that just vanishes
- **Extraction doesn't just redistribute wealth. It destroys value.**

**What I Couldn't Believe:**

That we accepted this as inevitable. That our entire economic system was built on mechanisms that inherently destroy value.

### YouTube Educational Videos

Created educational economics videos explaining these concepts:
- [Tariff Welfare Effects - Small Country Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvDcRrWqBog&list=PPSV)
- 21,000+ views over 13 years
- Demonstrates ability to explain complex economic concepts clearly
- Shows long-term commitment to making economics accessible

**The Question I Couldn't Answer:**

"Why don't we design systems that don't extract at all?"

## 2012-2022: The Operational Reality

### Workday Implementation Consultant (Decade of Experience)

**What I Built:**
- Implemented Workday (one of the world's most complex enterprise systems) for global companies
- Built data conversion and migration systems
- Managed international consulting teams
- Solved coordination problems at massive scale
- Worked in Ireland and across multiple continents

**What I Learned:**

**The answer to my 2012 question:** Coordination is hard.

- Non-extractive systems (cooperatives, commons, shared governance) are theoretically superior
- But they're operationally complex
- Extractive hierarchies (CEO → managers → workers) are simpler to coordinate
- **That's why extraction exists - it's operationally easier than cooperation**

**Key Insights:**
1. **Coordination costs** are the constraint that forces extraction
2. **Enterprise systems** can coordinate thousands of people, but require massive infrastructure
3. **Human coordination** has limits - that's why we centralize and extract
4. **The operational constraint** is what makes extraction "necessary"

**12 Side Hustles:**

Tried building 12 different businesses while working full-time. Each one taught me about:
- What works and what doesn't
- How to build and ship quickly
- How to test ideas in the real world
- The importance of systems thinking

## 2022-2025: The Paradigm Shift

### AI Removes the Coordination Constraint

**The Realization:**

AI fundamentally changes what's operationally feasible.

**What Changed:**
- AI can handle coordination that previously required human hierarchies
- AI can track complex relationships (royalties, ownership, contributions)
- AI can govern systems without extractive management
- AI can scale cooperation beyond what was previously possible

**The Insight:**

For the first time in history, **non-extractive systems are operationally feasible at scale.**

Mondragon proved cooperatives can work - but it took 70 years to build the human coordination mechanisms. What if AI could encode those mechanisms? What if we could scale non-extractive systems without requiring decades of cultural development?

## 2024-2025: Building The Collectiv

### From Theory to Practice

**The Hypothesis:**

If we combine:
1. **Legal protection** (PBC structure + Series LLCs)
2. **Economic incentives** (disincentivize extraction, incentivize contribution)
3. **AI governance** (reduce coordination costs)
4. **Shared access** (PBC owns assets, members share)
5. **Perpetual royalties** (smart contracts on derivatives)
6. **Cultural foundation** ("recovering individualist" → communitarian)

Then we can build an economic institution that:
- Eliminates extraction (and its deadweight loss)
- Scales beyond traditional cooperatives
- Creates sustainable wealth for members
- Lasts 1,000 years

### The Platform

**What I'm Building:**

A PBC creator platform that tests whether AI-native governance can enable non-extractive economics at scale.

**Key Features:**
- Individual Series LLCs for each creator's IP
- Smart contract royalties on derivative works
- Internal capital accounts (equity, not income)
- Disincentivized borrowing (keep capital in system)
- Shared access to PBC-owned assets
- AI-native governance and coordination
- Closed-loop permanent capital

**Current Status:**

- Year 1 of building and testing
- Real-world data being generated
- Hypothesis being tested in practice
- Learning what works and what doesn't

## 2026+: Formalizing with Academic Rigor

### Why a PhD Now?

**Not Because:**
- ❌ I need to learn economics (I have the foundation)
- ❌ I need to learn to build systems (I have a decade of experience)
- ❌ I need validation (I'm already building)

**But Because:**
- ✅ I want to **measure** what I'm building with academic rigor
- ✅ I want to **understand why** it works (or doesn't)
- ✅ I want to **contribute to economic theory** based on real-world data
- ✅ I want to **formalize the research** for others to build on
- ✅ I want to work with the **world's best institutional economists**

### The Research Questions

**Primary Question:**

"Can AI-native governance combined with non-extractive economic design enable cooperative systems to scale, and if so, how does this affect wealth distribution, coordination costs, and deadweight loss compared to traditional extractive platforms?"

**Secondary Questions:**

1. How much deadweight loss is eliminated in non-extractive systems?
2. What are the coordination costs of AI-governance vs. human hierarchies?
3. Can shared access economics scale without tragedy of the commons?
4. Do perpetual royalties on derivatives create sustainable income?
5. What legal structures protect cooperative missions from regulatory capture?
6. Can communitarian culture scale beyond small communities?
7. How do we design institutions that last 1,000 years?

### The Goal

**Not:** Write papers about what might work

**But:** Build systems that do work, measure the results, understand why, and contribute to economic theory based on real-world evidence

## The Complete Arc

### The Journey

**2012:** "Extraction is inefficient" (theoretical insight)
↓
**2012-2022:** "Coordination is the constraint" (operational reality)
↓
**2022-2025:** "AI removes the constraint" (paradigm shift)
↓
**2024-2025:** "Let's build and test it" (practical experiment)
↓
**2026+:** "Let's measure and formalize it" (academic rigor)

### What Makes This Unique

**Most PhD Applicants:**
- Read papers → Want to study topic → Apply
- No real-world experience
- Theory-focused
- Learning phase

**My Journey:**
- Studied theory (2012) → Built systems (2012-2022) → Realized AI changes everything (2022-2025) → Built the solution (2024-2025) → Want to formalize it (2026+)
- Decade of enterprise systems experience
- Practice-focused with theoretical foundation
- Contribution phase

### The Narrative

"I've been thinking about extraction inefficiency for 13 years. I spent a decade learning why extraction exists (coordination is hard). Then AI changed what's operationally possible. Now I'm building the non-extractive systems I was theorizing about in 2012. I want to bring academic rigor to this work while continuing to build and test at scale."

2. **Theoretical foundation** (economics degree, educational videos)
3. **Practical expertise** (decade of enterprise systems)
4. **Technical skills** (AI coding, platform building)
5. **Real-world testing** (building actual platform)
6. **Clear research questions** (based on real experience)
7. **Unique contribution** (practitioner-scholar with data)

### The Pitch

"Most PhD students want to learn. I want to formalize what I've been building for 13 years."

"Most PhD students study what might work. I'm measuring what does work."

"Most PhD students write papers. I'm building institutions."

## The 1,000-Year Vision

### Not a Startup, An Institution

**The Goal:**

Build an economic institution designed to last 1,000 years by:
- Eliminating extraction (no deadweight loss)
- Using AI for coordination (scales cooperation)
- Protecting the mission legally (PBC structure)
- Incentivizing contribution (disincentivize extraction)
- Building culture (recovering individualist → communitarian)
- Focusing on members (quality over quantity)
- Thinking long-term (sustainability over growth)

**The PhD Role:**

Bring academic rigor to measure, understand, and formalize what we're building so others can learn from it and build on it.

## Conclusion

This isn't a "I want to study economics" story.

This is a "I've been building toward this for 13 years, and now I want to formalize it with the world's best institutional economists" story.

**2012:** Couldn't believe we accepted extraction as inevitable

**2025:** Building systems that prove it's not

**2026+:** Formalizing the research for the next generation

**That's the 13-year arc.**
