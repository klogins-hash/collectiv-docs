# The Difference Between a PhD and a Doctorate Degree in Economics

## Understanding the Terminology

When people talk about doctoral degrees, the terms "PhD" and "doctorate" are often used as if they mean the same thing. However, there is an important distinction to understand. A **doctorate** is the general term for the highest level of academic degree you can earn in any field. It is sometimes called a "terminal degree" because it represents the end of formal education in that area. When you earn a doctorate, you have reached the top of the academic ladder and can use the title "Doctor."

A **PhD**, which stands for "Doctor of Philosophy," is actually a specific type of doctorate degree. Think of it this way: all PhDs are doctorates, but not all doctorates are PhDs. The doctorate category includes many different types of degrees, and the PhD is just one of them.

## Two Main Types of Doctorate Degrees

Across different fields, doctorate degrees generally fall into two main categories: **Academic Doctorates** and **Professional Doctorates**. Understanding the difference between these two types is essential for making sense of doctoral education.

### Academic Doctorates (Including the PhD)

Academic doctorates are research-focused degrees that emphasize creating new knowledge through original research. The PhD is the most common type of academic doctorate and is available in almost every field and discipline. When you pursue an academic doctorate, you spend several years conducting original research under the guidance of a supervisor or team of advisors. Your goal is to contribute something new to your field by developing new theories, discovering new facts, or creating new methods.

The process typically involves taking advanced coursework, passing qualifying examinations, developing a research plan, conducting your research, and then writing a dissertation (a long, detailed document explaining your research and findings). Finally, you must defend your dissertation in front of a panel of experts in an oral examination, sometimes called a "viva voce" or "defense." Academic doctorates have a **theoretical focus** and are designed for people who want careers in research or university teaching.

### Professional Doctorates

Professional doctorates, on the other hand, focus on applying existing knowledge to solve real-world problems in specific professions. Examples include the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Pharmacy (DPharm), Doctor of Psychology (PsyD), and Doctor of Education (EdD). While professional doctorates still require original research, a thesis, and a defense, the research is usually conducted in a real business, clinical, or organizational setting rather than purely in an academic environment.

Professional doctorates tend to have a more **practical focus** and are often completed part-time while students continue working in their regular jobs. These degrees are designed for people who want to advance in non-academic careers, such as business leadership, medical practice, or educational administration.

## What About Economics Specifically?

Here is where things get interesting: **in the field of economics, there is essentially no distinction between a PhD and a doctorate degree**. Unlike fields such as business (which has both PhD and DBA options) or education (which has both PhD and EdD options), economics does not have a separate professional doctorate. The **PhD is the standard and only terminal degree** in economics.

When you pursue a doctorate in economics, you are pursuing a PhD in Economics. This degree is considered a research degree and is the most advanced credential you can earn in the field. According to the American Economic Association, the PhD in economics typically takes five to six years to complete. This includes about two years of coursework in advanced topics like microeconomics, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, and econometrics, followed by several years dedicated to researching and writing a doctoral dissertation.

The PhD in Economics is designed to train students to conduct theoretical and empirical research. Students must pass preliminary or qualifying examinations before they can specialize in a particular area (such as labor economics, international trade, environmental economics, or financial economics). After completing all coursework, students develop a research plan, which is often reviewed in an oral examination before being approved. The PhD is awarded after the student successfully defends their dissertation in a final oral examination.

## Where You Get Your Economics PhD Matters (But It's Still a PhD)

While there is no separate professional doctorate in economics, there is one nuance worth understanding: you can earn a PhD in Economics from different types of departments. Most commonly, economics PhDs are awarded by **economics departments** within universities. However, some **business schools** also offer PhD programs in Economics or Business Economics. Notable examples include Stanford, Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard Business School, and MIT's Sloan School of Management.

The key difference between these programs is not the type of degree—they both award a PhD—but rather the **focus and specialization** of the training. Economics departments tend to offer rigorous training across a broad range of topics, including microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, economic history, international trade, and more. They emphasize formal theory and mathematical proofs. Business school economics programs, on the other hand, tend to focus more on applied microeconomics and business-related topics such as industrial organization, labor economics, organizational economics, and financial economics. They may place less emphasis on macroeconomics, economic history, or international trade.

Despite these differences in focus, both types of programs award the same degree: a PhD. Graduates from top business school economics programs can and do secure positions in leading economics departments, and the coursework is often very similar. Professors with economics PhDs who work in business schools typically earn higher salaries than their counterparts in economics departments, but the degree itself is the same.

## Key Takeaways

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Doctorate** | The general term for the highest academic degree in any field; a "terminal degree" |
| **PhD** | A specific type of doctorate; stands for "Doctor of Philosophy" |
| **Academic Doctorate** | Research-focused degree emphasizing original research and theory; PhD is the most common type |
| **Professional Doctorate** | Practice-focused degree emphasizing application of knowledge to real-world problems (e.g., DBA, MD, EdD) |
| **PhD in Economics** | The standard and only terminal degree in economics; no separate professional doctorate exists in this field |
| **Duration** | Typically 5-6 years: 2 years of coursework + 3-4 years of dissertation research |
| **Economics Department vs. Business School** | Both award PhDs, but differ in focus: economics departments are broader and more theoretical; business schools focus on applied micro and business topics |

## Why This Matters

Understanding the difference between a PhD and a doctorate is important because it helps you make informed decisions about your education and career. In most fields, you need to choose between an academic doctorate (like a PhD) and a professional doctorate (like a DBA or EdD) based on whether you want a career in research and academia or in professional practice.

However, in economics, this choice does not exist. The PhD is the universal standard for both academic and non-academic careers. Whether you want to become a university professor, a researcher at a think tank, an economist at a central bank, a consultant, or an analyst in the private sector, the PhD in Economics is the credential you need. According to research from the London School of Economics and Political Science, PhD holders earn significantly more than those with only a Master's degree—up to £3.10 more per hour, which can add up to substantial earnings over a career.

## Conclusion

To sum up, a **doctorate** is the umbrella term for the highest level of academic degree, while a **PhD** is a specific type of doctorate focused on research and theory. In economics, the PhD is the only terminal degree available, and it serves both academic and professional career paths. Whether you earn your PhD from an economics department or a business school, you will receive the same degree, though the focus and specialization of your training may differ slightly. Understanding these distinctions will help you navigate your educational journey and make the best choices for your future career.
