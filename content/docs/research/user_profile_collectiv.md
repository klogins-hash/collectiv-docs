# User Profile: Collectiv Project & PhD Program Search

## Research Focus
- **Core Question**: How do we take care of everyone's needs (Maslow's hierarchy) when half of those currently working are displaced by AI?
- **Project Name**: "The Collectiv"
- **Extensive Background**: Thousands of conversations with ChatGPT researching this topic

## Key Characteristics of Research Interest

### Primary Focus Areas:
1. **Collective economic systems** and alternative economic structures
2. **AI displacement** and labor market transformation
3. **Practical experimentation** - wants to actually BUILD the system, not just write about it
4. **Economic and social experiments** - frames work as experimental
5. **Commons-based governance** (mentions Ostrom)
6. **Universal needs provision** within capitalist framework

### Unique Approach:
- Wants to combine **academic rigor** with **practical implementation**
- Views academic path as way to strengthen legitimacy and mission

- Explicitly pro-capitalist but focused on broad prosperity
- Concerned about being mischaracterized as anti-capitalist
- Wants to work within the system while transforming it

## PhD Program Requirements

### Must-Haves:
1. **Support for practical experimentation** - not just theoretical research
2. **Encouragement of building/implementation** alongside research
3. **Openness to innovative economic structures** and systems
4. **Interdisciplinary approach** (economics + social systems + technology)
5. **Faculty interested in AI/automation impacts** on labor and economy
6. **Willingness to support unconventional research** directions

### Research Interests Alignment:
- Behavioral economics
- Experimental economics
- Labor economics (AI displacement)
- Institutional economics (Ostrom-style commons governance)
- Public economics
- Development economics (universal needs provision)
- Political economy

## Application Context
- Needs to understand dissertation format and process
- Wondering about proposal requirements for PhD applications
- Interested in whether master's thesis is required first
- Wants schools "fighting each other" for this research
- Ambitious goals (mentions Nobel Prize consideration)

## Tools & Approach Preferences
- Comfortable with AI-native tools (Cline, Manus.im, IDE)
- Prefers open source and custom-built solutions
- Wants academic-level sourcing and RAG systems
- Interested in using Gemini, Claude, Perplexity for research
- Wants version-controlled, wiki-style documentation with edit tracking
