# University of Chicago - Chicago Experiments Initiative

## Leadership
- **Faculty Director**: John List (world leader in experimental economics)
- Part of Becker Friedman Institute for Economics

## Focus Areas
UChicago's experimental economics program focuses on **field experiments** - observing everyday activities and responses in natural, real-world settings, not just lab experiments.

### Key Research Areas:

1. **Education**: Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center
   - Operated comprehensive preschool to test education methods
   - Tested family support and incentives for parents
   - Funded by Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation
   - Focus on causal effects and scalable interventions

2. **Science of Using Science**
   - Focus on **replication** and **scalability** of RCTs
   - Translating research to policy
   - Understanding when and how results scale to broader population

3. **Science of Philanthropy Initiative (SPI)**
   - Over a decade of research on charitable giving
   - Partnership with IUPUI Lilly Family School of Philanthropy
   - Understanding social preferences in philanthropic giving
   - Application to practitioners and policymakers

4. **Environment**
   - Behavioral economics approaches to energy conservation
   - Social norms and social signaling interventions
   - Real-world applications (residential electricity, airline fuel conservation)

## Methodology Strengths
- **Framed field experiments**: Subjects complete tasks they normally perform
- **Natural field experiments**: Observing people in everyday settings
- Recruiting relevant subject pools (business leaders, factory workers, borrowers, customers)
- Training students in field experimentation techniques
- Focus on **practical implementation** and **real-world impact**

## Why This Matters for User
- Strong emphasis on BUILDING and IMPLEMENTING, not just theorizing
- Real-world experimentation focus aligns with user's "economic and social experiment" framing
- Leadership in translating research to policy and practice
- Focus on scalability and replication (user wants to build something that works at scale)
