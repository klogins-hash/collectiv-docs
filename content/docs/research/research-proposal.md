# Research Proposal: AI-Native Non-Extractive Economic Institutions

## Dissertation Proposal for PhD in Economics

---

## Title

**"Designing Non-Extractive Institutions for 1,000-Year Sustainability: Can AI-Native Governance Enable Cooperative Economics at Scale?"**

---

## Abstract

This research investigates whether artificial intelligence can remove the coordination constraints that have historically limited non-extractive economic systems. Through a field experiment using a Public Benefit Corporation creator platform, I measure the effects of AI-native governance on coordination costs, wealth distribution, and deadweight loss compared to traditional extractive platforms. The research combines institutional economics, platform design, and AI governance to test whether non-extractive systems can scale beyond the limitations that have confined cooperatives to small communities. Preliminary data from the platform provides real-world evidence for analysis.

## Research Questions

### Primary Question

Can AI-native governance combined with non-extractive economic design enable cooperative systems to scale, and if so, how does this affect wealth distribution, coordination costs, and deadweight loss compared to traditional extractive platforms?

### Secondary Questions

1. **Deadweight Loss:** How much value destruction is eliminated in non-extractive systems compared to extractive platforms?

2. **Coordination Costs:** What are the coordination costs of AI-governance versus traditional human hierarchies?

3. **Shared Access:** Can shared access economics scale without tragedy of the commons when properly incentivized?

4. **Perpetual Royalties:** Do smart contract royalties on derivative works create sustainable income streams?

5. **Legal Protection:** How do different legal structures (PBC vs. cooperative vs. DAO) protect missions from regulatory capture?

6. **Cultural Sustainability:** Can communitarian culture scale beyond small communities with proper incentive design?

7. **Institutional Longevity:** What design principles enable institutions to sustain for centuries rather than decades?

## Theoretical Framework

### Institutional Economics

Building on Acemoglu and Robinson's work on institutional design, North's analysis of institutional change, and Ostrom's principles for governing commons, this research examines how AI changes the feasibility frontier for institutional design.

**Key Insight:** Institutions that eliminate extraction have always been theoretically superior but operationally constrained. AI may remove those constraints.

### Coordination Costs

Following Coase's transaction cost economics and Williamson's work on organizational economics, this research measures whether AI reduces coordination costs below the threshold that previously made extraction "necessary."

**Hypothesis:** AI-native governance can coordinate complex systems at lower cost than extractive hierarchies.

### Platform Economics

Drawing on platform literature (Parker, Van Alstyne, Choudary) and network effects theory, this research examines how non-extractive platforms create and distribute value differently than extractive ones.

**Key Question:** Can non-extractive platforms achieve similar network effects without extraction?

## Methodology

### Field Experiment Design

**Treatment:** Public Benefit Corporation creator platform with:
- AI-native governance
- Non-extractive economic design
- Shared access to PBC-owned assets
- Smart contract perpetual royalties
- Disincentivized extraction, incentivized contribution

**Control:** Traditional extractive creator platforms (Patreon, Substack, YouTube)

**Measurements:**
- Wealth distribution (Gini coefficient over time)
- Coordination costs (time, resources, friction)
- Deadweight loss (value destruction from extraction)
- Member satisfaction and retention
- Platform sustainability metrics
- Income sustainability (royalty streams)

### Data Collection

**Primary Data:**
- Platform transaction data
- Member surveys and interviews
- Coordination cost measurements
- Wealth accumulation tracking
- Governance decision analysis

**Secondary Data:**
- Comparative data from extractive platforms
- Historical cooperative data (Mondragon, etc.)
- Industry benchmarks

### Analysis Methods

**Quantitative:**
- Difference-in-differences estimation
- Regression discontinuity design
- Network analysis
- Time series analysis of wealth distribution

**Qualitative:**
- Case studies of successful/failed cooperatives
- Interviews with members about cultural shift
- Analysis of governance decisions
- Institutional design pattern identification

- AI governance reduces coordination friction
- Shared access to assets is valued by members
- Perpetual royalties create sustainable income streams
- Communitarian culture is emerging organically

**Challenges Identified:**
- Scaling while maintaining high-trust environment
- Balancing disincentives for extraction with member liquidity needs
- Measuring long-term effects with short-term data
- Regulatory uncertainty around PBC structure

## Significance

### Academic Significance

This research addresses a fundamental question in economics: can we design institutions that eliminate extraction while maintaining efficiency and scale? The answer has implications for:

- Institutional economics and design
- Platform economics and network effects
- AI and the future of work
- Wealth inequality and distribution
- Organizational economics

### Practical Significance

If successful, this research provides:

- A working model for non-extractive economic institutions
- Evidence that AI can enable cooperative economics at scale
- A blueprint for addressing AI-driven labor displacement
- An alternative to both UBI and traditional capitalism
- A path toward sustainable, equitable economic systems

### Social Significance

In an era of AI-driven abundance and potential mass displacement, this research tests whether we can build economic institutions that:

- Distribute wealth through ownership, not employment
- Eliminate extraction and its deadweight loss
- Scale cooperation beyond small communities
- Sustain for centuries, not just decades
- Create abundance through sharing, not scarcity through extraction

## Conclusion

This research combines thirteen years of thinking about extraction inefficiency, a decade of building enterprise coordination systems, and one year of real-world platform testing to answer a fundamental question: can AI enable non-extractive economic institutions to scale?

The answer matters because it determines whether we can build economic systems that eliminate deadweight loss, distribute wealth equitably, and sustain for centuries. It matters because AI is creating abundance while potentially displacing workers, and we need institutional innovations to match our technological ones.

Most importantly, the answer matters because it's not just theoretical. I'm building the institution, generating the data, and testing the hypothesis in the real world. This research formalizes and measures what's already being built.

That's the contribution I hope to make through this PhD research.
