# PhD Programs and Building Companies: Research Findings

## Key Insights

### General Feasibility
- **No legal prohibition** against starting a company during PhD
- **Practical challenge**: Time management between research and company building
- **Success stories exist**: Google (Larry Page & Sergey Brin - Stanford PhD students), Ginkgo Bioworks (4 MIT PhD students + professor)
- Stanford has produced more company founders (1,127 from 2006-2017) than any other university

### Leave of Absence Policies
- Most top programs allow **1 year leave of absence** (some allow up to 2 years)
- Reasons typically include: medical, family, military, or "personal reasons"
- **Key concern for user**: International student visa status during leave (F-1 requires enrollment)
- Some programs offer **paid leave** for 1 term (rare but exists)

### Programs Most Likely to Support This

#### 1. Stanford GSB/Economics
- **Culture**: Silicon Valley entrepreneurship culture
- **Track record**: Highest number of student-founded companies
- **Faculty**: Susan Athey works extensively with tech companies, understands practitioner-scholar model
- **Infrastructure**: Entrepreneurship resources across campus
- **Potential approach**: Frame company as field experiment generating research data

#### 2. MIT Economics/Sloan
- **Culture**: "Mens et Manus" (mind and hand) - building is core to MIT identity
- **Track record**: Ginkgo Bioworks, many tech startups founded by PhD students
- **Business Economics Track**: Joint program between Economics Dept and Sloan specifically for applied work
- **Faculty**: Strong connections to industry, understand real-world applications
- **Potential approach**: Emphasize technology + economics intersection

#### 3. University of Chicago
- **Culture**: More traditional academic, but Chicago Experiments Initiative shows openness to real-world work
- **Track record**: Less entrepreneurial than Stanford/MIT
- **Strength**: If you can frame company as large-scale field experiment, this could work
- **Potential concern**: More focused on academic placement than industry/entrepreneurship

## The "Company as Research Platform" Framing

### What Works:
Your situation is actually IDEAL for certain programs because:
1. **You're generating real economic data** - not hypothetical lab experiments
2. **Built-in research infrastructure** - the company IS the experiment
3. **Scalability testing** - exactly what Chicago's "Science of Using Science" cares about
4. **Natural field experiment** - the gold standard in experimental economics

### How to Frame It:
- "I'm building a Public Benefit Corporation creator platform that serves as a large-scale natural field experiment"
- "The company generates real-world economic data on [collective ownership, AI displacement solutions, alternative economic structures]"
- "My dissertation will analyze the economic outcomes from this real-world implementation"
- "This is practitioner-scholar research - I'm both building the institution and studying it"

### Precedents:
- John List has worked extensively with companies (Uber, Lyft) to run field experiments
- Susan Athey has worked with tech companies and serves on boards
- Many behavioral economists consult with companies while conducting research

## Specific Recommendations for User

### Best Fit Programs (Revised):

1. **Stanford GSB - Economic Analysis & Policy PhD**
   - Most entrepreneurial culture
   - Basic Income Lab provides institutional home for related research
   - Faculty understand tech/business intersection
   - **Key contact**: Susan Athey (tech economics), Juliana Bidadanure (Basic Income Lab)

2. **MIT - Business Economics Track (Joint Econ Dept + Sloan)**
   - Specifically designed for applied economics work
   - Strong tech connections
   - Culture of building
   - **Key contact**: Daron Acemoglu (automation/labor), Applied Economics Group

3. **Stanford Economics Department (separate from GSB)**
   - More traditional but still entrepreneurial environment
   - Can access GSB resources
   - Basic Income Lab affiliation possible

4. **University of Chicago - Economics**
   - IF you can get John List's buy-in on "company as field experiment"
   - Strong experimental economics credentials
   - More academic-focused but highest quality research

### Programs to Avoid:
- Harvard (too traditional, less supportive of entrepreneurship during PhD)
- Most pure economics departments (expect full-time academic focus)
- Any program without strong experimental/applied economics focus

## Critical Application Strategy

### What to Emphasize:
1. **You're not asking for permission to do a side hustle** - the company IS the research
2. **Data generation**: Emphasize the unique dataset you'll be creating
3. **Methodological innovation**: Natural field experiments at scale
4. **Policy relevance**: Solutions to AI displacement are urgent
5. **Academic rigor**: You're committed to rigorous analysis of the data

### What to De-emphasize:
1. Don't lead with "I want to build a company"
2. Don't frame it as business vs. academics
3. Don't emphasize profit motive (even though PBC allows it)

### Key Questions to Ask Programs:
1. "Do you have examples of students who conducted research using companies they founded/operated?"
2. "How does the program support practitioner-scholar research?"
3. "What's the policy on leave of absence for research-related activities?"
4. "Can I use data from a company I'm operating as my dissertation data?"

## Visa Considerations (Important!)
- F-1 visa requires full-time enrollment
- Leave of absence may jeopardize visa status
- **Alternative**: Maintain enrollment while building (most realistic)
- **CPT/OPT**: Optional Practical Training might allow company work if directly related to research
- **Consult immigration lawyer** before committing to any program
