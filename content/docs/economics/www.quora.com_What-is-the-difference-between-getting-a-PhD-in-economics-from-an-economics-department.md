In general, a US research university will award a PhD in Economics though an economics department. A business department may award a PhD (or DBA) in Business Economics, which I think is how Harvard does it.

The key difference would typically be that a business department would have a much narrower focus on specializations, or to put it more positively, have more opportunities toward things like industrial organization and business strategy.

But here’s the thing:

First you want to narrow down your possible area of research by using the journal literature, then second, identify those faculty who yo

Is it really possible to earn real cash just by watching YouTube every day?

Yes. I made up to $1,110 in only 15 days… from just watching YouTube videos in my free time.

I didn’t even want to share this because I’ll definitely get a ton of hate. I know what I say sounds ridiculous. But it’s all real with freecash.

I learned about it when my co-worker bought drinks on him after finding this “new side hustle”. When he said he gets paid for watching videos, I couldn’t stop laughing. Of course, I had to try it🤭 Got a $5 welcome bonus, invested it in an in-app purchase, and got it back as “cashback”.

Most B School PhD programs have a limited amount of economics —- they are marketing, or management or operations or whatever. A few B Schools have PhDs in economics. Most prominent are Stanford, Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard Business Economics and MIT. The Stanford and Harvard programs regularly place grads in the top 10 economics departments, the others less often. The B School programs tend to focus on micro and applied micro (labor, organizations, theory, IO) but do not do much history, macro or trade.

Not much difference actually- Econ professors at business schools get paid higher. Also, they tend to deal with more business related economics research such as financial economics, financial econometric. In terms of PhD, business econ PhD is comparable to econ department PhD. But econ department PhD believe that the econ department is more hard core. The coursework is also very similar in both departments in most cases. However, some schools will teach their own econ PhD micro/macro in the business school instead of taking it in the econ department. Many econ department PhDs work with busines
