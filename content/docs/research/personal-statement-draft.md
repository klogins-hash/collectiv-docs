## Opening: The 13-Year Question

In 2012, I was an economics student at Utah State University studying tariff welfare effects. I understood the mathematics: when you impose a tariff, consumer surplus decreases by more than the combined increase in producer surplus and government revenue. The difference—deadweight loss—is value that simply disappears. Extraction doesn't just redistribute wealth. It destroys value.

What I couldn't believe was that we accepted this as inevitable. That our entire economic system was built on mechanisms that inherently destroy value through extraction.

I spent the next decade trying to answer a question: **Why don't we design systems that don't extract at all?**

## The Operational Reality (2012-2022)

The answer came through practice, not theory. For ten years, I implemented Workday—one of the world's most complex enterprise coordination systems—for global companies. I built data conversion systems, managed international consulting teams across continents, and solved coordination problems at massive scale.

I learned that non-extractive systems—cooperatives, commons, shared governance—are theoretically superior but operationally complex. Extractive hierarchies are simpler to coordinate. That's why extraction exists: **coordination is hard**. The operational constraint is what makes extraction seem "necessary."

Mondragon proved that worker cooperatives can eliminate extraction and create shared prosperity. But it took seventy years to build the coordination mechanisms, trust networks, and institutional knowledge. The question became: what if we could encode those mechanisms? What if we could scale non-extractive systems without requiring decades of cultural development?

---

## The Paradigm Shift (2022-2025)

Then AI fundamentally changed what's operationally feasible. AI can handle coordination that previously required human hierarchies. It can track complex relationships, govern systems without extractive management, and scale cooperation beyond what was previously possible.

For the first time in history, **non-extractive systems are operationally feasible at scale.**

But I also realized something else: if we're going to build alternative economic institutions, we need to build them to last. Most "alternative systems" fail because they're vulnerable to regulatory capture, cultural drift, or tragedy of the commons. We need to design for sustainability, not just innovation.

## Building The Collectiv (2024-2025)

I've spent the last year building a Public Benefit Corporation creator platform that tests whether AI-native governance can enable non-extractive economics at scale. The system combines several key elements:

**Legal Protection:** PBC structure gives corporate legal rights that protect the mission long-term. Cooperatives and DAOs can be regulated away; corporations have more rights than individuals. Each creator's intellectual property is protected in individual Series LLCs, which we facilitate and manage.

**Economic Incentives:** We disincentivize extraction—anything taking money out of the system—and incentivize contribution—keeping capital in long-term. The PBC owns shared assets that members access, eliminating the inefficiency of individual ownership and the extraction by financial intermediaries.

**AI Governance:** AI handles the coordination that previously required extractive hierarchies. Smart contracts manage perpetual royalties on derivative works, creating sustainable income streams from network effects.

**Cultural Foundation:** We're building what I call a "recovering individualist" philosophy—moving from individualism to communitarian thinking. This requires recognizing that we now have increased power and tools as a species, and we have a responsibility to use them wisely.

**Long-Term Focus:** We're not trying to help everyone or grow virally. We're focused on helping our members and building an organization designed to last one thousand years. Quality over quantity. Sustainability over growth.

## Why a PhD, Why Now

I'm not applying to a PhD program because I need to learn economics, or because I need to learn to build systems, or because I need validation. I'm applying because I want to bring academic rigor to work I've been building toward for thirteen years.

I want to measure what I'm building with proper methodology. I want to understand why it works—or doesn't work. I want to contribute to economic theory based on real-world data. I want to formalize the research so others can learn from it and build on it. And I want to work with the world's best institutional economists to understand how to design institutions that truly last.

The research questions are clear because they emerge from real experience:

Can AI-native governance combined with non-extractive economic design enable cooperative systems to scale? How much deadweight loss is eliminated compared to traditional extractive platforms? What are the coordination costs of AI-governance versus human hierarchies? Can shared access economics scale without tragedy of the commons? What legal structures protect cooperative missions from regulatory capture? How do we design institutions that last one thousand years?

## Why MIT, Why Business Economics

Professor Acemoglu's work on institutional design and sustainability is exactly what I'm building. His research on why nations fail or succeed based on their institutions directly informs my question: how do we design institutions that eliminate extraction and sustain for centuries?

The Business Economics Track offers the perfect structure for this research. The small cohort provides flexibility for unconventional approaches. The dual advisor model gives support from both economic theory and business practice. The program's explicit focus on "leveraging rigorous economic analysis to address complex business and policy issues" describes exactly what I'm doing.

MIT's interdisciplinary culture means I can access CSAIL for AI research while maintaining rigorous economic methodology. The Boston-Cambridge ecosystem provides opportunities for real-world testing and validation.

Most importantly, MIT values building real systems, not just theorizing about them. I'm not interested in writing papers about what might work. I'm building systems that do work, and I want to measure the results, understand the mechanisms, and contribute to economic theory based on empirical evidence.

## The Contribution

My background is unusual for a PhD applicant. I have thirteen years of thinking about extraction inefficiency, a decade of building enterprise coordination systems, technical skills in AI and platform development, and a working platform generating real economic data. I'm not in the learning phase—I'm in the contribution phase.

Most PhD students study what might work. I'm measuring what does work. Most PhD students want to understand existing systems. I'm building new ones and want to understand why they succeed or fail. Most PhD students write papers. I'm building institutions.

This research has the potential to fundamentally change how we think about economic institutions in an age of AI-driven abundance. If non-extractive systems can scale with AI-native governance, we can eliminate the deadweight loss that has been accepted as inevitable for centuries. If shared access economics can work without tragedy of the commons, we can dramatically improve resource efficiency. If we can design institutions that last one thousand years, we can build economic systems that create sustainable abundance rather than extractive scarcity.

## Conclusion

In 2012, I couldn't believe we accepted extraction as inevitable. In 2025, I'm building systems that prove it's not. In 2026 and beyond, I want to formalize this research with academic rigor, working with the world's best institutional economists to understand how to design non-extractive systems that truly last.

This isn't a "I want to study economics" story. This is a "I've been building toward this for thirteen years, and now I want to formalize it with the world's best institutional economists" story.

That's why I'm applying to MIT's Business Economics Track. That's why I want to work with Professor Acemoglu. And that's why I believe this research can contribute something meaningful to economic theory and practice.
