---

## General Questions

### What is The Collectiv?

A creator cooperative. We're building tools and infrastructure together. You crowdfund to get in, you own your IP and cooperative equity, and you can borrow against your equity to build wealth.

We're not a finished platform. We're a group of creators building something together.

### Who is this for?

Creators who want to own what they make and build wealth together.

**You might be a good fit if you:**
- Want to own your work completely
- Want to build long-term wealth, not just earn income
- Want to collaborate with other creators
- Want to participate in democratic governance
- Want access to shared tools and resources

### What stage are you at?

Early. We've got some AI tools, some creators, and some ideas. We're building.

**That's the point.** You're not joining something finished. You're helping build something you'll own part of.

### Is this legit?

Yes. We're legally structured as a Public Benefit Corporation organized as a cooperative.

**This means:**
- Legally registered entity
- Member-owned and operated
- Mission-aligned structure
- Transparent operations

## Membership Questions

### How do I join?

**Step 1:** Apply (tell us what you want to build)
**Step 2:** Make your crowdfund contribution
**Step 3:** Get access to tools, resources, and governance

### How much does it cost to join?

Your crowdfund contribution amount. (Specific amounts TBD based on founding member input.)

**This is not a monthly fee.** It's a one-time investment that gives you equity.

### Can I join if I'm not in the US?

Yes. The Collectiv is open to creators globally.

**Note:** Some features (like borrowing against equity) may have geographic limitations based on financial partners.

### What if I can't afford the full contribution?

We're exploring options for:
- Payment plans
- Reduced contributions for early members
- Work-equity arrangements

Propose ideas in governance. We're figuring this out together.

### Can I leave anytime?

Yes. You can resign your membership.

**What happens:**
- Your equity is settled at current valuation
- You keep 100% ownership of your IP
- You lose access to tools and governance

### Can I be kicked out?

Only for serious violations (harassment, fraud, illegal activity).

**Process:**
- Requires supermajority vote (66%+)
- You have right to appeal
- Equity is settled fairly

---

## Ownership Questions

### What do I own?

**Two things:**

**1. Your IP (100%)**
Everything you create is yours. Complete ownership and control.

**2. Cooperative Equity**
You own a stake in the cooperative itself—the tools, infrastructure, pool capital, and everything we build together.

### Do you take a cut of my revenue?

No. You keep 100% of revenue from your work.

**The cooperative doesn't:**
- Take platform fees
- Take revenue shares
- Own your IP
- Control your pricing

### What if I create something using cooperative tools?

**You still own it 100%.**

The tools are resources you have access to as a member. Using them doesn't give the cooperative any ownership of what you create.

### Can I use my work however I want?

Yes. License it, sell it, give it away—your choice.

### What happens to my IP if I leave?

**You keep it.** Always.

Your IP ownership is independent of your membership status.

## Equity Questions

### How is equity calculated?

Based on:
- Your crowdfund contribution amount
- Time as a member
- Cooperative pool growth
- Revenue and value generated
- Transparent formula (published in governance docs)

### How do I see my equity value?

Your member dashboard shows:
- Current equity value
- Historical growth
- Borrowing capacity
- Pool capital status

**Updated monthly.**

### Can my equity go down?

Theoretically yes, if the cooperative loses value.

**But:**
- We're focused on sustainable growth
- Conservative financial management
- Diversified revenue streams
- Member-aligned incentives

**The goal is steady growth over time.**

### Can I sell my equity?

Potentially, but borrowing against it is usually smarter.

**Why?**
- Selling = taxes (30-40% gone)
- Selling = you stop benefiting from growth
- Borrowing = no taxes, equity keeps growing

### What if I need cash?

**Borrow against your equity.** That's the whole point.

**How it works:**
- Request loan through member dashboard
- We handle the financial infrastructure
- You get cash, no taxes
- Your equity keeps growing

### How much can I borrow?

Typically 50-70% of your equity value.

**Depends on:**
- Your equity value
- Lending partner terms
- Market conditions
- Your borrowing history

### What are the interest rates?

Competitive rates based on your equity value and market conditions.

**The key:** As long as your equity grows faster than the interest rate, you're building wealth.

### Do I have to borrow?

No. It's an option, not a requirement.

Some members borrow regularly. Others never borrow. Both are fine.

## Financial Questions

### Where does my contribution go?

Into the general cooperative pool.

**The pool funds:**
- Tool development (60-70%)
- Infrastructure and operations (20-30%)
- Member benefits and support (5-10%)
- Reserves (5-10%)

**Exact allocations decided by member vote.**

### How does the cooperative make money?

**Current:** Member crowdfund contributions
**Near future:** Tool revenue (if we add external users)
**Long term:** Services, partnerships, ecosystem revenue

**The goal:** Grow equity value for members.

### Will there be distributions?

Maybe eventually, but that's not the focus.

**We'd rather:**
- Reinvest in tools and infrastructure
- Grow equity value
- Enable borrowing against equity

**Distributions = taxes. Equity growth = wealth building.**

### Is this profitable?

We're not focused on profit extraction. We're focused on value creation for members.

**Success means:**
- Tools that members use and love
- Equity that grows over time
- Members building wealth
- Sustainable operations

### What if the cooperative loses money?

We have reserves and conservative financial management.

**If we ever faced financial trouble:**
- Member vote on response
- Potential additional contributions
- Potential service reductions
- Transparent communication throughout

## Governance Questions

### How does governance work?

One member, one vote. Democratic decision-making.

**You vote on:**
- Budget allocation
- Tool priorities
- Strategic decisions
- Governance changes

**See the Governance doc for full details.**

### Do I have to participate?

You should, but there's no strict requirement.

**Minimum:** Try to vote on major decisions.

**Ideal:** Participate in discussions, join working groups, propose ideas.

**Governance only works if members participate.**

### Can I propose ideas?

Yes. Any member can propose anything.

**Process:**
1. Draft proposal
2. Post for discussion
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Call for vote
5. If approved, help implement

### What if I disagree with a decision?

**Vote against it.** That's how democracy works.

**If it passes anyway:**
- You can propose an alternative
- You can work to change it later
- You can appeal to member assembly
- You can leave (but you probably won't want to)

### Who runs the day-to-day operations?

**Working groups** handle ongoing operations.

**Coordinators** facilitate and organize.

**Members** do the actual work.

**No one "runs" the cooperative.** We coordinate together.

## Tool Questions

### What tools are available?

**Current:**
- AI content generation
- Creator productivity tools
- Project infrastructure

**Coming soon** (based on member votes):

### Can I request features?

Yes. Any member can request features.

**Process:**
1. Submit feature request
2. Community discussion
3. Development working group evaluates
4. Prioritized in roadmap
5. Implementation and release

### What if a tool doesn't work?

**Contact Member Support working group.**

We'll fix bugs and issues. Tools need to work for members.

### Can I build my own tools?

Yes. You can build whatever you want.

**You might even:**
- Propose adding your tool to the cooperative
- Collaborate with other members on tools
- Use cooperative infrastructure for your tools

### Do I have to use the tools?

No. They're resources available to you, not requirements.

Use what's helpful. Ignore what's not.

## Community Questions

- Difficult to join
- Intimidating governance

**Us:**
- Casual and accessible
- Clear economic model (crowdfund-to-equity)

## Skeptical Questions

### Is this a scam?

No. We're a legally registered entity with transparent operations.

**You can verify:**
- Legal registration documents
- Financial reports
- Governance records
- Member testimonials (once we have them)

### Why should I trust you?

**You shouldn't blindly trust anyone.**

**What we offer:**
- Complete transparency
- Democratic governance
- Legal protections
- Member ownership

**You're not trusting us. You're joining us.**

### What if this fails?

**Your IP is always yours.** That never changes.

**Your equity:** Would be settled based on remaining cooperative assets.

**But:** We're building this to last. Conservative finances, member-aligned incentives, sustainable model.

### Isn't this just another platform?

No. Platforms extract value. We create value for members.

**The difference:**
- You own equity, not just pay fees
- You govern, not just use
- You build wealth, not just earn income

### Why would this work?

**Because the incentives are aligned.**

Members own the cooperative. Members govern the cooperative. Members benefit from the cooperative's success.

**No outside investors demanding extraction.**
**No platform taking cuts.**
**No misaligned incentives.**

### What's the catch?

**There isn't one.**

**The trade-off:**
- You invest upfront (crowdfund contribution)
- You participate in governance (takes some time)
- You're early (not everything is built yet)

**The upside:**
- You own equity that grows
- You build wealth over time
- You help shape what gets built
