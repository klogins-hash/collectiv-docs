description: Our strategy for growth and impact
---

## The Mission

Build the best creator cooperative this world has ever seen.

**Ambitious goal:** Get public endorsements from [Taylor Swift](https://www.taylorswift.com) and [AOC](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov) by end of 2026.

**Why?** Because if we build something that matters, people who matter will notice.

---

## The Narrative

We're building a binary choice in the creator economy.

**Collectiv:** Building wealth together. Creators own what they make. Democratic governance. Long-term equity.

**Extractiv:** Platforms taking cuts. Corporations extracting value. You're a renter, not an owner.

**The choice is clear.** Which side are you on?

---

## The Founding Contribution Drive

**Goal:** $5M in founding contributions over 12 months

This funds tool development, infrastructure, and operations while we build toward sustainability.

### Phase 1: Stewards (Months 1-3)

**Target:** $500K from 12-24 strategic partners

**Who:** Strategic partners, advisors, and early believers who want to help shape the cooperative.

**Contribution level:** Higher (exact amounts TBD by founding members)

**Benefits:**
- Founding equity stake
- Strategic input on direction
- Early access to everything
- "Steward" status and recognition

### Phase 2: Builders (Months 4-6)

**Target:** $1.5M from 100-200 core builders

**Who:** Creators ready to build together. Active participants who will shape the tools and culture.

**Contribution level:** Mid-range (exact amounts TBD)

**Benefits:**
- Founding equity stake
- Active role in tool development
- Governance participation
- "Builder" status and recognition

### Phase 3: Members (Months 7-12)

**Target:** $3M from public membership

**Who:** All creators who want to own what they make and build wealth together.

**Contribution level:** Standard (exact amounts TBD)

**Benefits:**
- Equity stake
- Access to all tools and resources
- Governance rights
- Full membership

## Membership Ritual: "Pledge, Pay, Post"

Make joining memorable and meaningful.

### Step 1: Pledge

Sign the [Public Pledge](public-pledge.md) - your commitment to cooperative principles.

### Step 2: Pay

Submit your crowdfund contribution. This goes into the cooperative pool and gives you equity.

### Step 3: Post

Share your membership card and photo on social media. Show you're part of something.

**Inspiration:** [Eras Tour](https://www.taylorswift.com/tour) style - make it an event, not just a transaction.

---

## The Credit System (Future)

A self-regulating economy that rewards contribution and solves the free-rider problem.

**Note:** This is a future enhancement. Current focus is on crowdfund-to-equity model. But here's where we're headed.

### How You Earn Credits

**Financial Contribution (30%):** Your crowdfund contribution and any additional contributions.

**IP Revenue (30%):** Revenue generated by your licensed IP (if you choose to license through the cooperative).

**Work Contribution (20%):** Tasks completed for the cooperative (tool development, member support, governance, etc.).

**Loyalty/Seniority (20%):** Length of continuous membership. Long-term members are valued.

### The Rules

**Monthly Reset:** Use credits or they contribute to the general fund. Incentivizes active participation.

**Credit Sharing:** "Leg Up" program to support other members. Build community, not competition.

**Conservative Spending:** Incentivized by "Restored Member" status for those who contribute more than they use.

**This creates a self-sustaining economy where contribution is rewarded and free-riding is minimized.**

---

## The Endorsement Strategy

How we get Taylor Swift and AOC to notice us.

### Phase 1: Indirect Influence (Months 1-12)

**Build the narrative.**

Make "Collectiv vs. Extractiv" a clear binary choice in the creator economy.

**Recruit strategically.**

Target creators adjacent to Taylor Swift's network (Swifties, Squad members) and AOC's network (progressive creators, activists).

**Show results.**

Demonstrate that the cooperative model works. Members building wealth. Democratic governance functioning. Tools being used.

### Phase 2: Warm Introductions (Months 13-24)

**Leverage the network.**

Use member connections for private introductions to people in their networks.

**Demonstrate impact.**

Show concrete examples of "restoration" - creators who left extractive platforms and are now building wealth in the cooperative.

**Build credibility.**

Media coverage, case studies, member testimonials, financial transparency.

### Phase 3: The Ask (Months 25-36)

**Formal pitch.**

Invite Taylor Swift and AOC to become "Honorary Stewards" - public supporters who believe in the mission.

**Public campaign.**

"Come Home to The Collectiv" - positioning the cooperative as the natural home for creators who care about ownership and equity.

**The pitch:**

"You've built your career on owning your work and empowering others. The Collectiv is doing the same for all creators. Join us."

---

## Why This Matters

### Taylor Swift

She [famously fought for ownership](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-masters-controversy-timeline-9617924/) of her master recordings. She understands the value of owning your work.

**The connection:** The Collectiv is built on the principle that creators should own what they make.

**The ask:** Endorse the cooperative as the future of creator ownership.

### AOC

She's a [progressive voice](https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov) for economic justice and worker empowerment.

**The connection:** The Collectiv is a democratic, worker-owned cooperative building economic justice for creators.

**The ask:** Endorse the cooperative as a model for the future of work.

### Why Both Matter

**Taylor Swift** brings the creator community.

**AOC** brings the political and economic justice community.

**Together** they represent the coalition we're building: creators who want to own their work and build wealth together.

The strategy is: Build something so good that they can't ignore us.
