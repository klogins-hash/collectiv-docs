# The Actual System Design (Corrected)

## Based on Voice Memo - January 14, 2026

---

## Core Principle: Disincentivize Extraction, Incentivize Contribution

**Key Correction:** The PBC does NOT pay loan interest. We want to **disincentivize** borrowing (taking money out of the system) and **incentivize** keeping capital in the system long-term.

---

## Legal Structure

### 1. Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)

**Why PBC, Not Cooperative or DAO:**

Corporations have more legal rights in the United States (and globally) than any other entity:
- More rights than individuals
- More rights than nonprofits
- More rights than cooperatives
- More rights than DAOs

**Strategic Reasoning:**

"It would be very easy for them to say, hey, a cooperative can't do this or a DAO can't do this. We're putting it within a PBC because it will be protected forever."

**Protection:**

The rules of the game can't easily change because corporate rights are deeply entrenched in law. This protects the mission for the long term (1,000 years).

### 2. Individual Series LLCs for Each Creator's IP

**Structure:**

- Each creator's intellectual property is stored in an individual Series LLC
- Some creators have multiple LLCs (e.g., Taylor Swift's "1989" album and "Reputation" album would be separate Series LLCs)
- High-profile creators might have their own holding company with multiple LLCs under it

**What We Provide:**

"We facilitate all that. We make it so they don't have to worry about that."

- Legal setup and management
- IP protection
- Royalty tracking
- Compliance and administration

## Economic Model

### Core Incentive Structure

**Disincentivize:**
- Anything taking money OUT of the system
- Borrowing against equity
- Extraction of value

**Incentivize:**
- Anything bringing money INTO the system
- Keeping capital in long-term
- Contributing to the commons
- Building shared value

### How This Works

Unlike traditional "Buy, Borrow, Die" where borrowing is free (interest paid by entity), in The Collectiv:

- **Borrowing is possible** but has real costs to the borrower
- **This discourages extraction** from the system
- **Capital stays plugged in** and compounds
- **Long-term thinking** is rewarded

---

## Shared Access Economics

### The Inefficiency of Individual Ownership

**Current System:**

"It's inefficient economically for each person to own their own car, own their own house, do all that, right?"

**Who Benefits from Individual Ownership:**
- Mortgage companies
- Banks
- Brokers
- Insurance companies
- All extracting value without adding convenience

**The Problem:**

"They used to add some kind of convenience or value, but if we can now, within a cooperative system, create all that convenience and value internally, right? Then we're really... And having it all within one super high trust-based system, then those groups are not necessary anymore, right?"

### The Solution: PBC-Owned Shared Access

**Model:**

1. **PBC buys assets** (cars, housing, equipment, tools)
2. **Members share access** to these assets
3. **High-trust system** manages allocation and usage
4. **AI coordinates** access and maintenance
5. **Value stays in system** instead of being extracted by intermediaries

**Benefits:**

- More efficient use of resources
- Lower cost per member
- No extraction by financial intermediaries
- Shared maintenance and improvement
- Scales with membership

## The AI Displacement Context

### The Problem We're Solving

"In a situation where AI displaces over half of workers, right? And when they're not needed in order to produce a massive amount of products and services, et cetera, then how do we take care of those people? What does that look like?"

### Our Hypothesis

"Economically, our hypothesis is that we move way more towards shared access."

**Why:**

When AI can produce abundance with minimal human labor:
- Individual ownership becomes even more inefficient
- Shared access becomes the optimal model
- High-trust cooperative systems can coordinate this
- AI handles the coordination that previously required markets

---

## Not Universal Basic Income

### What We Initially Thought

"When we set this out, we set it out to try to help everyone get a universal basic income."

### What We Learned

"Turns out that's actually not the best way to go about it, and it also just decreases the quality of all of this."

### The Better Approach

"What's going to be better is if we create cooperatives that people are a part of that contribute to that type of a thing."

**Key Insight:**

- Not trying to help everyone with UBI
- Creating cooperatives where members contribute
- Focus on quality over quantity
- **This is our test case** of being the first cooperative to do this

---

## Focus: Members, Not Everyone

### The Strategic Decision

"We would love to be able to help as many people as we can, but if we focus on trying to help everyone, that's not going to be great."

### What We're Actually Doing

"What we need to do is focus on helping our members and overall creating an organization that can last for a thousand years. And that's our goal."

**Priorities:**

1. **Help our members** (not everyone)
2. **Build for 1,000 years** (not quick growth)
3. **Quality over quantity** (sustainable, not viral)
4. **Long-term sustainability** (not short-term impact)

---

## The Cultural Foundation: "Recovering Individualist"

### The Higher Way of Thinking

"Our goal is to do a couple of things. One is to help train and teach people to live in this kind of higher way of thinking, because this requires a higher level of... I always call myself a recovering individualist."

### Why This Matters

"It's just like we now have increased power, tools, capabilities as a human species. And it's very important that we recognize that and recognize that we have a responsibility to use that responsibly."

### The Shift Required

**Old Model:**
- Individualism
- Everyone for themselves
- Competition over cooperation
- Short-term thinking

**New Model:**
- Communitarian thinking
- Community first
- Cooperation over competition
- Long-term abundance

**The Transition:**

"The old ways of thinking and old models aren't going to fit this, right? We can't be individualists anymore. You can, but it's not going to be the best."

---

## The Communitarian Model

### Community First

"Everyone who goes at it individually, everyone who touts individualism, we really have to move into what's more of a communitarian model, which is like, hey, we put the community first, right?"

### Why This Works

"Because we know that by all of us doing the best we can to help each other out, that is going to create long-term abundance."

### Historical Evidence

"And we show that through history and the situations that have done that."

**Examples:**
- Mondragon (70 years of cooperative success)
- Historical commons that sustained communities
- Mutual aid societies
- Successful cooperatives globally

## The Complete System Architecture

### Legal Layer
1. **PBC** (corporate legal protection)
2. **Series LLCs** (individual IP protection)
3. **Cooperative governance** (member control)

### Economic Layer
1. **Disincentivize extraction** (borrowing has costs)
2. **Incentivize contribution** (keeping capital in)
3. **Shared access** (PBC owns, members share)
4. **Perpetual royalties** (smart contracts)

### Cultural Layer
1. **"Recovering individualist"** philosophy
2. **Communitarian model** (community first)
3. **Long-term thinking** (1,000 years)
4. **Responsibility** (use power wisely)

### Operational Layer
1. **AI coordination** (reduces friction)
2. **High-trust system** (enables sharing)
3. **Closed-loop capital** (stays in system)
4. **Quality focus** (members, not everyone)

---

## The Mission

### Primary Goals

1. **Help our members** create long-term abundance
2. **Build an organization** that can last 1,000 years
3. **Train and teach** people to think communitarian
4. **Demonstrate** that non-extractive systems can scale
5. **Create a model** others can learn from and build on

### What Success Looks Like

**Not:**
- ❌ Helping everyone (UBI)
- ❌ Viral growth
- ❌ Quick returns
- ❌ Individual wealth maximization

**But:**
- ✅ Sustainable member wealth
- ✅ Long-term institutional stability
- ✅ Cultural transformation
- ✅ Proof that it works at scale
- ✅ 1,000-year sustainability

---

## The Hypothesis

"So yeah, so that's our hypothesis."

**In Full:**

By combining:
- Legal protection (PBC + Series LLCs)
- Economic incentives (disincentivize extraction)
- Shared access (PBC-owned assets)
- AI coordination (reduces friction)
- Communitarian culture (community first)
- Long-term focus (1,000 years)

We can build an economic institution that:
- Eliminates extraction and its deadweight loss
- Scales beyond traditional cooperatives
- Creates sustainable abundance for members
- Lasts 1,000 years
- Serves as a model for post-AI-displacement economics

## Key Differences from Initial Understanding

### What I Got Wrong

1. **PBC pays loan interest** → NO, borrowing is disincentivized
2. **"Buy, Borrow, Die for everyone"** → NO, focused on members, not everyone
3. **UBI-adjacent** → NO, explicitly rejected UBI
4. **Growth-focused** → NO, sustainability-focused
5. **Help everyone** → NO, help members and build for 1,000 years

### What I Got Right

1. **Non-extractive economics** → YES, core principle
2. **AI coordination** → YES, enables scale
3. **Legal structure matters** → YES, PBC for protection
4. **Series LLCs for IP** → YES, individual protection
5. **Shared access** → YES, PBC owns assets
6. **Long-term thinking** → YES, 1,000-year vision
7. **Cultural shift needed** → YES, recovering individualist

---

## Conclusion

This is not "Buy, Borrow, Die for everyone."

This is **"Build a 1,000-year institution that helps members create long-term abundance through communitarian cooperation, shared access, and non-extractive economics."**

The focus is:
- **Quality** over quantity
- **Members** over everyone
- **Sustainability** over growth
- **1,000 years** over 5 years
- **Community** over individual
- **Contribution** over extraction

**That's the actual system.**
